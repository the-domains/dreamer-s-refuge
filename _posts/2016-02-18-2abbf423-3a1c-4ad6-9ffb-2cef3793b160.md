Meditation Update 1
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fb5b03e0-6ef2-439b-9cd5-44e8a4644187.jpg)

Had an interesting experience during meditation today, I was meditating for about an hour, and heard something that sounded like a baseball bat hitting a ball, a distinct "crack". 

Then a few minutes later, all of a sudden, my body started vibrating, it felt as if electricity was running through it, a fast "hum".  And I also heard it, also sounded like a vibrating hum of energy.  My body became stiff, distant and my hands felt warm, as this was going on and my mind became really focused (while I was also excited about what was going on because this was new).

I think the excitement disrupted my mindfulness because that feeling slowly became weaker and then went away, and I came out of the meditation; looking at how long I had been doing it, the Insight Timer said about 49 minutes.
